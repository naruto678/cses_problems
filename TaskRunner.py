    The main objecttive of the module is to be able to run soem file directly . 
    usage would be as follows: 
        The directory would be as follows: 
            cses_problems: 
                    -> Problem1: 
                        input.txt
                        problem_statement.txt
                    ->Problem2: 
                        input.txt
                        problem_statment.txt

        ./TaskRunner.py <problem-name>
        ./TaskRunner.py <problem-name> --file <file-name to be used instead of the input.txt file present in the problem name directory >
        
    
    Exception_handling : 
        if input.txt is not found then prompt the user to put the input.txt file there ---> Future versions for this should try to login to the cses_problme set site 
            and try parsing the html and getting the input to check it out . This is also would be used to document my journey of going through the cses problem set

    Ideas: 
    Also idea could be to run a single command and get the entire cses problem set and make the directory directly . 
    Currently let us just support python and then we could move on to java / go-lang or rust. my new fav languages
